1. Both loops: "for" and “while" loops perform the same task. however, the difference is that 
the “while loop” is more explicit as you can read the order more obviously. 
“for loop” is a condensed version of the three elements needed for a loop, the initiated 
variable “var x = 0”, the test for an exit condition “(x <= width)” and finally 
the increment “x = x + 50” and put them into one line. 

2. The four components to a "for loop” is  the initiated variable “var x = 0;”, the test
for an exit condition “(x <= width);”, the increment “x = x + 50” and finally the shape
and size of what the computer will draw “ellipse (x, 200, 25, 25);”

3. A nested loop is a loop within a loop, an inner loop within the body of an outer one. 
How this works is that the first pass of the outer loop triggers the inner loop, which 
executes to completion. Then the second pass of the outer loop triggers the innerloop 
again. This repeats until the outer loop finishes.
